- in frontend we create zap like select trigger(it tells where to get data like webhook from github,or google form)
  and action (what to do when you get data like send email,send solana ,write entry on docs ,etc) and return user a  webook url to connect github or google docs etc
- in Primary or main backend we just authenticate ,store zap recieved from backend to database and also frontend ask
  main backend for list of available trigger and actions
- hooks will get data from connected sites like github,goole docs etc and it simple store it to database 
- processor simple get zap from database and publish it to kafka queue
- worker takes zap from kafka queue and perform its actions
